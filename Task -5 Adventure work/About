About The Project:
    I am sharing Adventure Works Cycles Report, in which I used Power BI to gain insights from data belonging to the Adventure Works Cycles bicycle company. 
The data consists of details on clients, products, categories, subcategories, sales, returns, and geographical areas. 
Adventure Works needs to monitor key performance measures like sales, revenue, profit, and returns as well as compare regional performance, 
examine trends and projections at the product level, and pinpoint high-value clients. 
I was able to create a storytelling dashboard using the robust data visualization and analysis features of Power BI.
